# Bingo100
 Simple program to calculate and track the bingo numbers up to 100 results
 The program generates two random numbers between 1 and 10, multiply them and puts them on a list so that you can track what numbers already appeared. 
 You should tell the kid the first two numbers so that they make the operation and mark the result in their cards

## Usage
 Start the program and you will have three options:
 First one is to press "a" to generate two numbers, prints them on the screen, print the result and print the list of results that already appeared
 Second one is to press "n" to print just the operation of two numbers
 Third one is to press "l" to print just the list of results

 Note: Please keep in mind that all three options do exactly the same, they just print on the screen different things but they make the same operation regarding the quiz.
